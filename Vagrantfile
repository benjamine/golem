  # Provider-specific configuration so you can fine-tune various

  # Example for VirtualBox:
  #
  # config.vm.provider :virtualbox do |vb|

  #   vb.gui = true
  #
  #   # Use VBoxManage to customize the VM. For example to change memory:

  # View the documentation for the provider you're using for more
  # information on available options.
